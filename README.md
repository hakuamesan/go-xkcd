# XKCD Downloader

This tiny program helps you to download all the XKCD comics. (https://xkcd.com)

It tries to use concurrency and gets multiple images (along with the mouse hover text) at the same time.

# Options

- -a Download All
-  -n Download only a specific Number
-  -r Download only a Range <from#> <to#>
-  -f Download starting From
-  -t Download until <To#>
-  -v Display version
-  -d Some (helpful) Debug comments

# Warning

Code needs some cleanup. Some/several bugs may exist. Sometimes it doesn't finish cleanly. 

It skips downloading the image if the same image is already found in the current directory.

# Use at your own risk.
